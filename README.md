# Project Description
Implementation of semantic segmentation for street driving scenes using the CamVid dataset. Semantic segmentation is accomplished with a U-Net model buit with the Keras functional API with a pre-trained VGG16 encoder connected to a decoder trained using Google Colab Pro.
Work was completed as the final project for the Computer Vision (CSCI E-25) class taken as part of the Data Science Master's Degree Program at Harvard University.
